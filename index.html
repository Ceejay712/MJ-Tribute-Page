    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot. He is the most awarded individual music artist in history. <img src="images/6739.jpg" alt="">

        The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and "Thriller" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an artform and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of MTV and continued to innovate with videos for the albums Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995). Thriller became the best-selling album of all time, while Bad was the first album to produce five U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles</p>

          >Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (born Rolihlahla Mandela /mæn'dɛlə/;
          Xhosa:[xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂:la]; 18 July 1918 - 5 December 2013)</strong
        >
        was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader and
        philanthropist who served as the first president of South Africa from 1994
        to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first
        elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government
        focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling
        institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation.
        Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the
        president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.

        A Xhosa speaker, Mandela was born into the Thembu royal family in Mvezo,
        Union of South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and
        the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in
        Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African
        nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth
        League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government
        established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged
        whites, Mandela and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. He was
        appointed president of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence
        for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of
        the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was
        unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by
        Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party
        (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in
        association with the SACP he co-founded the militant uMkhonto we Sizwe in
        1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. He was arrested
        and imprisoned in 1962, and, following the Rivonia Trial, was sentenced to
        life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state.
